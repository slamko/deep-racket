*** Little deep learning framework based on Perceptron algorithm
Implemented in Typed Racket for better performance with Matrix library

Library part lives in deep.rkt file:

To try it out in your racket code:
```lisp
#!/usr/bin/env racket
#lang racket

(require "deep.rkt")
(require math/matrix)

(define xor-output
  (list
    (matrix [[0]])
    (matrix [[1]])
    (matrix [[1]])
    (matrix [[0]])))

(define xor-input
  (list 
    (matrix [[0 0]])
    (matrix [[0 1]])
    (matrix [[1 0]])
    (matrix [[1 1]])))

(define nn (make-nn '(2 5 1)))
(define trained-nn (learn nn xor-input xor-output 1 (* 10 1000)))

(perform trained-nn xor-input xor-output)
```

app.rkt provides similar interface from the command line:
```
./app.rkt 10000 -a 2 5 1
```
